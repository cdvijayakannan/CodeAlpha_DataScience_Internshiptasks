TASK 1 - TITANIC CLASSIFICATION Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors weremost likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more. Objective:

Develop a predictive model to understand factors influencing survival during the Titanic, aiming to identify patterns among passenger data, including name, age, gender, and socio-economic class. The tragedy spurred global safety improvements for ships. Challenge

Create a robust model to determine characteristics associated with higher survival rates among passengers. The dataset is available in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
Workflow Summary:

Problem Definition: Clearly define and understand the problem objectives.

Data Setup: Load necessary libraries and import the dataset.
